## Introduction

This repository provides a series of tutorials that demonstrate the basics of OpenCV. Each tutorial is designed to be simple and easy to follow, covering topics such as image processing, feature detection, and object tracking.

## Installation

To run the tutorials in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NaimulHasanEmon/OpenCV-Basics.git
   cd OpenCV-Basics
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Tutorials

1. **Image Processing:**
   - Reading and displaying images
   - Basic image operations (resize, crop, rotate)
   - Color space conversions
   - Image filtering (blur, sharpen, edge detection)

2. **Feature Detection:**
   - Corner detection (Harris, Shi-Tomasi)
   - SIFT, SURF, and ORB

3. **Object Tracking:**
   - MeanShift and CamShift
   - Tracking with OpenCV

4. **Video Processing:**
   - Reading and writing videos
   - Background subtraction
   - Frame differencing

Each tutorial is located in its own directory and includes a README file with detailed explanations and code examples.
